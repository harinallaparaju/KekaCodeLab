                        Imagine an international gateway
                        where goods and merchandise flow
                        across borders. Where countries
                        lower taxes, reduce red tape, and
                        eliminate road blocks. Where
                        companies import goods and
                        merchandise directly into a Free
                        Trade Zone - and then ship products
                        out duty free.

                        The Miami Free Trade Zone connects
                        North America, Europe and Asia to
                        Latin America and the Caribbean via
                        direct air and sea transportation
                        links, plus rail and expressway.
                        Operated by FTZ World Services, the
                        47-acre Zone (#372) saves
                        companies money and time.

                        FTZ World Service has the unique
                        advantage of being the licensed

                        Zone. We offer state-of-the-art
                        facilities and a stellar track record

                        technological support, warehousing,
                        and storage. Because FTZ
